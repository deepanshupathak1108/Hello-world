<h2>Star Topology</h2>
<p>In Star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node<p>
<h2>Ring Topology</h2>
<p>In a Ring Topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with exactly two neighboring devices. A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes</p>
<h2>Mesh Topology</h2>
<p>In a mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via a particular channel. Every device is connected to another via dedicated channels.</p>
<h2>Bus Topology</h2>
<p>Bus Topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. It is bi-directional.</p>
<h2>Tree Topology</h2>
<p>Tree topology is the variation of the Star topology. This topology has a hierarchical flow of data. In Tree Topology, protocols like DHCP and SAC (Standard Automatic Configuration) are used.<p>
<h2>Hybrid Topology</h2>
<p>Hybrid Topology is the combination of all the various types of topologies we have studied above. Hybrid Topology is used when the nodes are free to take any form.<p>
